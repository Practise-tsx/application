URL app

Description

Most of us are familiar with seeing URLs like bit.ly or t.co on our Twitter or Facebook
feeds. These are examples of shortened URLs, which are a short alias or pointer to a
longer page link. For example, I can send you the shortened
URL http://bit.ly/SaaYw5 that will forward you to a very long Google URL with search
results on how to iron a shirt.
